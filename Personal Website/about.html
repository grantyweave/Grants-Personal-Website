    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <body>
        <p>
            I’m a Plumber, who loves to learn something new every day. I started learning C#/.NET on my own but after a
            3 months of learning decided to start learning C# through Grand Circus After-Hours Bootcamp, so that I can
            start a new career in the world of technology. I started to be interested in programming when my brother
            started showing me online code tutorials. I’m passionate about programming because I love creating things
            and watching them come to life. My plans are to become a full-time developer, and to work on apps and games
            with my friends just for fun.
