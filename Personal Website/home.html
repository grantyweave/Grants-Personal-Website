                If you can keep your head when all about you
                Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
                If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
                But make allowance for their doubting too;
                If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
                Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
                Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
                And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

                If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
                If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
                If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
                And treat those two impostors just the same;
                If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
                Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
                Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
                And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

                If you can make one heap of all your winnings
                And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
                And lose, and start again at your beginnings
                And never breathe a word about your loss;
                If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
                To serve your turn long after they are gone,
                And so hold on when there is nothing in you
                Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

                If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
                Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
                If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
                If all men count with you, but none too much;
                If you can fill the unforgiving minute
                With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
                Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
                And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!" - Rudyard Kipling

        <h2>My Development Journey</h2>

        <body>
            <p>
                My journey has been crazy. If I'm honest I thought every next step would be a failure, but here I am. I
                love
                coding more every day and I love meeting people smarter than me who are nice enough to teach me in a
                kind
                manner. I hope with all of my hard work I am able to give back to those less fortunate than I and lay
                down
                my life and selfish desires for those who have less or worse; nothing.

        <h2>My Hometown</h2>

        <body>
            <p>
                My hometown is just your average suburb, but where it really shines is when you get out of your comfort
                zone
                and talk to strangers. 90% of the time they won't talk to you, but if you start an interesting
                conversation,
                you're just bound to make their year.
